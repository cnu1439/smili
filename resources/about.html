    </h2>
    <hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;">The Simple Medical Imaging Library
    Interface (SMILI), pronounced 'smilie', is a light-weight (application and)
    user-interface framework that provides a very high level (Qt) interface to
    powerful image processing and scientific visualisation algorithms from the
    suberb <a href="http://www.itk.org/">Insight Toolkit (ITK)</a> and
    powerful <a href="http://www.vtk.org/">Visualisation Toolkit (VTK)</a>. <br>
    <br>
    It allows one to build stand-alone medical imaging applications quickly and
    easily, while having a multitude of processing and visualisations built-in.
    It has special support for the interaction of images and 3D models by
    allowing
    simultaneuous visualisation of both in a standardised way and/ortogether in
    a single view. The library can also be used to test algorithms on existing
    data and has tools for visually inspecting results from processing pipelines
    (via mechanisms such as&nbsp; off-screen rendering etc.)<br>
    <br>
    SMILI was developed by Dr. Shekhar S. Chandra in his spare time during
    his
    post doctoral fellowship at the Australian e-Health Research Centre,
    CSIRO and Research Fellowship at the University of Queensland from 2011
    to
    2014 under the expert supervision of Dr. Jurgen Fripp, Dr. Jason
    Dowling, Dr. Olivier Salvado and Prof. Stuart Crozier (see the <a href="credits.html">credits
      page</a> for more detail). It is in some
    way a spiritual successor to the <a href="http://qcplusplus.sourceforge.net/">Discrete
      Geometry
      3D Viewer (DGV)</a> he developed in his Ph.D. <br>
    <br>
    It was born out of the
    necessity of having a easy to use but light
    weight (in terms of processing) library to develop user interface
    applications that everyday researcher could leverage to make their work
    more readily accessible to others. The prototype viewer, called sMILX,
    was developed that soon grew to be the defacto application for medical
    imaging and shape analysis within our lab.<br>
